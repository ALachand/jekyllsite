**The applications are now closed**

## Context
We are looking for a doctoral candidate to join our new HCI lab in Lyon, France. The candidate will be part of the PLACED project in collaboration with the Aarhus University, Chalmers University, several public libraries and the National School of Libraries in France. The project aim is to reinvent the services provided by city libraries and to design and develop news types of place- and activity-centric digital services. Whereas library services typically focus on providing access to a collection of physical media, PLACED services support activities (e.g. hackathons, public readings, discussion groups) in the library. The groundbreaking aspect is that these services capture knowledge generated through these activities, make them a part of the library's collection, and allow future library users to explore and access them.

The candidate will be co-supervised by [Aurélien Tabard](http://www.tabard.fr) in Lyon, and [Clemens Nylandsted Klokmose](http://www.klokmose.net/clemens/) in Aarhus. The majority of the time will be spent in Lyon with a 3 to 6 months stay in Aarhus. Project meetings will happen in Lyon, Aarhus, Goteborg and Brussels.

## Candidate role and profile
The Ph.D. student will design and develop new ubiquitous visualization tools to increase the visibility of activities going on in libraries and connect them to existing resources (books, magazines, dvds, etc.) The candidate will work in collaboration with post-docs in Lyon (specialised in Libraries), Aarhus (HCI), Goteborg (Participatory Design).

We are looking for a candidate with a strong record in any of the following topic areas:
1. HCI; 2. Ubiquitous Computing; 3. Information Visualisation; 4. Interaction Design.
Familiarity with Web technologies, especially front-end, would be a plus.

A Master’s degree in computer science, design, or a related area is required. The position is fully funded for 3 years. Salary starts at around 2,000 EUR/month before taxes and can be increased with teaching.

## How to apply
The application should sent by email to Aurélien Tabard. It should include be a single PDF containing: 1) a one page statement of interest, 2) academic CV, 3) course transcripts from Master's and Bachelor with grades, and 4) names and contact information of two recommenders.
<!-- Review of the applications will start on March 1st, 2017 until the position is filled (The page will be updated to reflect the opening status). -->

**The applications are now closed. The position should be filled in September. Feel free to drop me a message nonetheless, other positions will open in the future.**

For further information, please contact Aurélien Tabard - [firstname.lastname@univ-lyon1.fr](firstname.lastname@univ-lyon1.fr)

## About LIRIS and Université de Lyon
LIRIS is the main computer science lab in Lyon, it is composed of about 320 professors, researchers and phd students. It is a joint lab of CNRS (the French National Center for Scientific Research) and Université de Lyon. The Université de Lyon is the main French higher-education and scientific center outside the Paris metropolitan area. It is the result of the merger in 2017 of 4 public universities and 7 grandes écoles.
Lyon is the second largest metropolitan area in France, and the french gastronomic capital. The Alps are 1h30 away by car and the Mediterranean sea less than 1h30 away by train.

## About Digital Design and Information Studies and Aarhus University
Aarhus University is ranked as no 65 in the 2016 Shanghai Ranking of World Universities and no 98 in the 2016 Times Higher Education. The university has one of the largest communities of HCI-related researchers in Europe with more than a dozen permanent faculty related to HCI, two of which are members of the CHI academy. According to Microsoft Academic Search Aarhus University is the top 2 university in HCI outside the US and UK.

Aarhus University hosts the interdisciplinary Center for Participatory Information Technology (PIT) directed by prof. Susanne Bødker and prof. Kim Halskov. The student will become part of the PIT community and have access to the expertise of numerous high-profile researchers within human-computer interaction and interaction design. The student will furthermore have access to the facilities of Center for Advanced Visualization and Interaction (CAVI), that includes a number of mixed reality platforms, such as tangible tabletops and various kinds of pervasive computing technologies.
